A dynamic model of insider trading to examine informational content of prices, the liquidity characteristics of a speculative market, and the value of private information to an insider.
Three types of trades - (1) single risk neutral insider, (2) random noise traders, (3) competitive risk neutral market makers.

(1) Single trader has access to private observation of the ex post liquidation (true final payoff) value of the risky asset.
(2)Uninformed noise traders trade randomly; 
(3)Market makers set prices efficiently (in the semi-strong sense) conditional on information they have about the quantities traded by others.
Semi strong sense (from Fama's Efficient Market Hypothesis) : prices reflect all publicly available information but not private information.

Liquidation value is the net worth of a company's physical assets, like real estate, fixtures, equipment, and inventory, during bankruptcy.

At each auction, trading takes place in two steps. 
(i) Insider and the noise traders simultaneously choose the quantities they will trade (market orders)
Insider's information consists of his private observation of the liquidation value of the asset, as well as past prices and past quantities traded by himself. He does not observe current or future prices, or current or future quantities traded by noise traders. 
The random quantity traded by noise traders is distributed independently from present or past quantities traded by the insider and independently from past quantities traded by noise traders.
(ii) Market makers set a price, and trade the quantity which makes markets clear. When doing so, their information consists of observations of the current and past aggregate quantities traded by the insider and noise traders combined.
